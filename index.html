        <p>We work on making efficient autonomous racing cars.</p>

    <h2>We want to be the first high school team to win <a href = "https://f1tenth.org">F1TENTH</a>.</h2>
    <p>
        Celertias Research brings together the smartest high school students to work on software and hardware for small RC-style cars to race on unseen tracks,
        to move towards a future where progressing autonomous driving is accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a collective, we do research on everything from efficient artificial intelligence edge computing to the physics of turning a four-wheel vehicle.
        We plan to work in the open and release everything to the public, for free as in freedom. We provide students with guidance, mentorship, and funding to build and create.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are gearing to launch. Applications are not public because we work in-person in Fremont, CA. Our timeline is TBD but we do plan on establishing smaller projects as we scale towards our goal.
        Funding is paramount and we are open to angel checks.
